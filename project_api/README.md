# ProjectApi

This is a project from a api with just one route (`ping`) that returns "PONG" in json format.


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Route
``ping route:
  (http://localhost:4000/api/ping)
``
